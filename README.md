# OAK-D_Drone_Landing
Drone Landing project for Insitu Inc.
This project uses an OAK-D camera from Luxonis DepthAI and a CoDrone Pro drone to simulate a VTOL vehicle landing from the back of a moving ship. 

With an OAK-D camera attached to a 1m x 1m x 1m box as a landing space, when the camera detects a drone within a 3m distance, send commands to land the drone on the landing space within 60 seconds.
